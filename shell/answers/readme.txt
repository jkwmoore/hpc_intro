    The files in this directory are a few answers 'with some explanations' 
 to the exercises for the Shell Script Programming Module.
  
   We recommend that you try to perform the exercises on your own and then
 compare your scripts with the ones given here.
  
   There are usually many ways of writing a script and the answers given
 here may not necessarily be better than your own solutions.
  
   All solutions given here are Bourne/Bash Shell solutions unless the 
 file suffix used is <.csh>
 
 
 Exercise 4a : Reading two variables from command line : ( read1 / read1.csh )
          4b : Reading from terminal:  ( read2 / read2.csh ) 
          4d : Manipulating the Path variable.
               C-Shell solution :( cshrc )
               Bash solution : ( addpath ) 
             
      
 Exercise 5a : Using the back quote to set variables: ( backq1.sh ) 
 Exercise 5b : As above but using whoami : ( backq2.sh ) 
               
  
 Exercise 6 :  Counting the total number of files in two directories:
               The scripts  (countf1 , countf1.csh , countf2 , countf2.csh
	       countf3 and countf3.csh ) are some of the likely solutions 
		to this exercise.
		 
 Exercise 7 :  Using awk to check the SGE loading:  ( prob7_awk.sh ) 		 
		
 Exercise 8 :  Using sed to customise a job:  ( p8_sed_sge.sh , p8a_sed_sge.sh ) 
 
		
 Exercise 9a : Setting the node name: The scripts ( nodename1.sh and nodename2.sh
               and nodename3.sh  ) are three examples of the 'bourne' solution 
	       to this exercise.
