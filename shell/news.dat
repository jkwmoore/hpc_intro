25-08-15 CHANGES TO THE WAY OF ACCESSING ANSYS PRODUCTS ON ICEBERG
          We have removed the ability to run ansys related products such as
	  fluent without having loaded a module first. 
	  Before using any ANSYS product on an iceberg worker-node you must
	  first type :  module load apps/ansys 
	   
	  If you need to use a specific version type:  
	        module avail apps/ansys  
	 and use the module load command for that version.
	 e.g  module load apps/ansys/14.5 
	 
	 following this you can simply type one of the commands:
	   fluent, ansys , runfluent , runansys , ansyswb , icemcfd  
	 to pick up the version that was declared by your last module load
	 command.	
	  
*****************************************************************************
30-07-15 MAPLE updated to version 2015
         All Maple related software is updated to the latest version (2015) 
	 on iceberg. 
	 The commands  maple , xmaple , mint and mhelp will now run the
	 latest release.  
	 Release 16 have been withdrawn due to licenses no longer supporting
	 that version
*****************************************************************************
22-07-15 ANSYS Software License Server is changing.
          ATTENTION ALL ANSYS & FLUENT users who have this software installed
	  on their own workstations.
          The current ANSYS licenses are due to expire by the end of July 
	  and the new licenses are now being served from a new license server.

          In order to be able to continue to use ANSYS after this month on 
	  your workstations, you must perform the following procedure on 
	  your workstation where you have any ANSYS product installed.
           Run the ANSYS  Client ANSLIC_ADMIN utility as Administrator 
        (Right click on it in the start menu and select Run as administrator)
          Select 'Specify the license server Machine' 
          Highlight the license server line  ( 2325 1055  licserv.shef.ac.uk )
          Click on the 'Edit selected Server machine'  button
          Change the Hostname 1 field to    ansyslm.shef.ac.uk
          Click OK button
          Click Close button
          Close the Client ANSLIC_ADMIN utility window
	  
          Please note that if you use ANSYS only on Managed Windows Service 
	  Workstations or on iceberg, you do not need to take any action.

*****************************************************************************
03-07-15 From today the default version of MATLAB on iceberg will be 2015a
         Although typing matlab on the worker nodes will load the default
	 version of MATLAB, it is strongly recommended to use the module 
	 command to access MATLAB.
	   i.e.  type  module load apps/matlab
	 Earlier versions of MATLAB can also be accessed via the module 
	 command. For example:   module load apps/matlab/2014a 
	 
	 Please see the following page for further information-
	 rcg.group.shef.ac.uk/iceberg/software/apps/matlab.html

03-03-15 HPC@SHEFFIELD  ANNUAL HPC EVENT ON 26TH OF MARCH 

         Our annually held HPC@sheffield Research Computing event will take 
	 place on Thursday the 26th of March in Firth Hall. 

         This major event is aimed at research students and staff to inspire 
	 and inform them about many exciting research activities that are 
	 taking place by using the local and national high performance 
	 computing facilities.  

         The emphasis of this year's event will be global "grand challenges"
         and will feature presentations on research and research techniques 
	 that are used to address these challenges with the aid of high 
	 performance computing.    
	 Registration is required and can be made via:

*****************************************************************************
24-02-15 New method of accessing the popular software items on iceberg******

         We are introducing a new method of access to commonly used software
         packages such as abaqus, ansys, fluent and matlab via module
         commands.  Type-    module avail apps      to see the currently 
         available application module files. 
         You will see each application with a list of maintained versions.
         For example, to access 2013b version of MATLAB you will need to type
                         module   load apps/matlab/2013b
           followed by-  matlab
         To access the latest version of abaqus on iceberg  type; 
                         module    load  apps/abaqus 
           followed by-  abaqus 
         To access version 15.0 of all ansys products you will need to
         type -        module load apps/ansys/15.0  
         followed by -
	           fluent, ansys, ansystext, ansyswb, icem, icemcfd or cfx  
		   
         For any module, if you do not specify the version number then the 
         highest numbered version will be made available.  
         Therefore in the above example we could have just typed 
                  module load apps/ansys  to get the latest version (15.0) 

         We shall remove the older method of access to these packages via
         names such as ansys145 , matlab2014a   etc....
         Further information about the module command can be found at URL
         http://www.shef.ac.uk/wrgrid/using/modules 
*****************************************************************************
23-02-15 Removal of R command.
	 The default R command which is availible on the nodes has been 
	 replaced by the apps/R module. This old (2.15) version of R will be
 	 permanently deleted on the 1st April. Until then this version of R
	 can be accessed by running `/usr/bin/R` instead of `R`.
*****************************************************************************
18-02-15 Removal of older software from iceberg.
         We are starting our "spring-clean" on iceberg to remove very old 
	 versions of software and we will make further announcement 
	 regarding this. Abaqus Version6.5 will be one of the casualties 
	 as we already have Versions 6.9, 6.11 , 6.12 , 6.13 on iceberg.
	 After installing version 6.14 we will remove further older versions.
	 Please email hpchub@sheffield.ac.uk if you depend on a version  
	 of abaqus older than version 6.11.

05-09-14 ***** VERY IMPORTANT iceberg ANNOUNCEMENT ***** 

         Our major iceberg upgrade work is starting soon. 
 
         23rd Sept to 29th Sept:   NO iceberg SERVICE !!!
	 29th Sept to  6th Oct :   Partial service provided on the AMD nodes.
         6th October           :   Service resumes on the upgraded iceberg
                                   cluster.
	 As /fastdata filestorage area will also be significantly upgraded 
         it will not be available during the entire upgrade period. Also the
	 dedicated 'Project' queues  will be disabled during this period as 
	 the upgrade effects the dedicated nodes. 
	 
	 Although we do not expect the data currently stored on /fastdata
	 areas to be lost, there is always a risk of data loss. As CiCS takes
	 no backups of /fastdata, we urge /fastdata users to backup their 
	 important files that reside on /fastdata as soon as possible. 
	  
	 We appreciate that the loss of service will inconvenience our users
	 but we are hoping that this will be amply compensated by the 
	 improvements to the iceberg service as well as to /fastdata.	
	 	   
         Further announcements about the upgrade progress will follow.

17-06-14  foxit PDF viewer is now available on iceberg
          Foxit is an excellent and very quick PDF file viewing utility.
          This free software is mainly used on WINDOWS platforms as a quick
          alternative to ADOBE Acrobat Reader. We have made the Linux version
          available on the iceberg cluster nodes for viewing of PDF files.
          This software seems to contain some client-dependent features which
          results in producing spurious startup error messages, depending on
          the method of terminal access to iceberg but continues to work well
          To access it type :  foxit   
          You can also type :  foxit  yourfile.pdf   to skip opening the file
          from within the viewer.
*****************************************************************************
11-06-14  INTEL Compilers are updated.
          INTEL compilers have been updated to version 14.0 on iceberg 
	  The command: 
	     module load compilers/intel 
	  will now access version 14.0 of this compiler.
	  This module will also load the java module so as to be able to 
	  use the graphical features of the Intel debugger.
	  
	  If you wish to continue to use the previous version please use the
	  command : module load compilers/intel/12.1.5 
	   
*****************************************************************************
30-05-14  PGI compilers have been updated.  
          The latest version of the PGI compilers(14.4)have been installed on
	  iceberg cluster. The command;
	   
	      module load compilers/pgi 
	      
	  will now access the latest version (14.4) of the PGI compilers. 
	  If you find that your programs no longer work with this version 
	  please report to us immediately via email hpchub@sheffield.ac.uk .
	  
	  You can always revert back to using the previous version via the 
	   command;    module load compilers/pgi/13.1   

*****************************************************************************
03-06-14  UPDATING the GRID ENGINE 
          SGE software, used for submitting and controlling jobs on iceberg  
	  by providing the 'qsub', 'qrsh', 'qsh', 'qstat'... commands will be
	  updated on this date.
	  Work will start at 9am and is expected to last for about 30 mins.
	  This work should not affect any jobs that are already running when 
	  the update starts. However it will not be possible to submit new 
	  jobs or view or modify the status of existing jobs whilst the work 
	  takes place.  
          If you use the 'qmon' graphical interface to manage your jobs on 
	  iceberg then you will notice that the interface has changed 
	  following the upgrade, however the functionality will remain the 
	  same.You should also check that your job scripts do not specify 
	  the SGE_ROOT variable, as the location of this directory will 
	  change as part of the update, and jobs referencing the old 
	  installation will fail following the update.  
	  In general it is no longer necessary to set SGE_ROOT as part of 
	  your job file.

          Contact hpchub@sheffield.ac.uk if you have any concerns regarding 
	  this upgrade.

25-06-13  A fix for the ANSYS-WORKBENCH GEOMETRY-DESIGNER component.

          On Tuesday, 25th of June we will update the Sun Global Desktop(SGD)
          software that controls the myapps portal which is used for 
	  connecting to iceberg via an internet browser. 
	  We apologize to ANSYS Workbench users for the continuing disruption
	  to this software since the iceberg upgrade and ask them to test 
	  their problems again after the fix has been implemented.
*****************************************************************************
14-06-13  More Ansys & Fluent licenses are now available.
 
          Parallel Fluent & Ansys users will be pleased to know that we 
	  have increased the number of available licenses after ANSYS donated
	  extra licenses to the Insigneo Group.
	  Research licenses went up from 100 to 130 seats.
	  HPC licenses went up from 175 to 207 cores.

15-05-13  PGI compilers are no longer automatically available on iceberg.

          Since the recent iceberg upgrade, PGI compilers are no longer
	  available as default on iceberg. 
          If you are a regular PGI Fortran and C Compilers user you will now
	  need to type:     module load compilers/pgi   
          on the command line before using these compilers. 
	  Better still you can add a line which reads 
	            module load compilers/pgi 
          into the end of your .bashrc file which will then make these 
	  compilers available as soon as you log into a worker node 
	   ( just like the old days). 

*****************************************************************************
09-05-13 ABAQUS V6.12 is installed on iceberg.

23-04-13 Accessing the abaqus example input files.
         Abaqus example input files, as referenced in the Abaqus manuals 
	 can be copied into the users own working directory by the use of the
	 abaqusexample  command.  
	 When abaqusexample is issued without any parameters it lists the 
	 entire contents of all the Abaqus examples directory which is a
	 huge list!. You can then copy the ones you need into your directory
	 by using the filename as the first and only parameter. 
	  Example1:  abaqusexample boltpipeflange_axi_solidgask.inp  
	  Example2:  abaqusexample bolt* 
	 The first example copies a single file. 
	 The second examples copies all the files starting with the name bolt 
	  
*****************************************************************************
18-04-13 runabaqus command bug fix.

14-10-11 License server issues 

         Floating license server had to be restarted on 4:00am and 8:30am 
	 today to clear problems relating to ArcGIS. 
	 This may have effected some long running Ansys, Fluent and Matlab 
	 jobs on iceberg as they use the floating licenses supplied by this 
         server.	  
 
*****************************************************************************
11-10-11 As of 4pm today, fluent command runs version 13 instead of the 
         previous version (12).Similarly runfluent now submits ver.13 jobs.
	 Previous version is still available via fluent12 and runfluent12
	 commands.
*****************************************************************************
07-10-11 Another terminal emulator ( rxvt) is installed on iceberg. 
         rxvt is a faster 'but trimmed down' version of xterm
	 that may respond better on slower connections and is available
	 on iceberg head and worker also the nodes.
	   type:   rxvt &     to check it out.
	   type:   rxvt -help for information on usage parameters.
*****************************************************************************
29-09-11 FLuent Version 13 is available and will be made the default version
         in a weeks time.
	   The following commands are available;
	    fluent       : Default version of Fluent
	    fluent13     : Version 13 of Fluent
	    fluent12     : Version 12 of Fluent
	    fluent-teach : Default teaching version of Fluent 
	    fluent13teach : Teaching using V13
	    fluent12teach : Teaching using V12
	    runfluent    : Submit a Fluent batch job using default version.
	    runfluent13  : Submit Fluent V13 job
	    runfluent12  : Submit Fluent V12 job
	NOTE1: Default version is currently 12 but will very soon be 13  
	       following another news announcement.
	NOTE2: The only difference between the teaching version and the 
	      full version is the number of cells that can be handled.
	      Teaching version can handle only upto 500,000 cells
	      but because it is smaller it will run more efficiently and    
              without the risk of running out of licenses.
*****************************************************************************
23-09-11 Default version of ANSYS is now V13.
         ANSYS Version 13 is installed and available on iceberg.
         Although the previous version (V12) remains available with no plans
         to remove it yet, we recommend ANSYS users to move onto the new
         version for greater stability.
          The following is a list of Ansys related commands on iceberg; 

         ansyswb ( or ansys13wb ): Ansys 13 Workbench
         ansys                   : Ansys version 13 (With GUI interface ),
         ansys13                 : Ansys 13 (Line-mode interface),
         ansys12wb               : Ansys 12 Workbench,
         ansys12                 : Ansys 12 (Line-mode interface), 
         runansys                : Submit an Ansys 13 batch job,
         runansys12              : Submit an Ansys 12 batch job,
         ansysteach              : Run teaching version of V13 (with GUI)
         ansysteach12            : Run teaching version of V12 (with GUI)
    Note: We have large numbers of teaching licenses for running problems
          of upto 500,000 nodes in size on Linux or Windows platforms.          
*****************************************************************************
23-09-11 Default version of Matlab is now 2011a on iceberg cluster.
         As of this morning, matlab command on the worker nodes will invoke
         2011a ( rather than the previous 2010b ) version of Matlab. 
         This should have no visible effect on Matlab users but let us know
         if that is not the case for you. 
         Also Matlab related commands mex and mbuild now use version 2011a.
         Version 2010b is still available via the command:  matlab2010b  
          and the associated commands mex2010b & mbuild2010b 
*****************************************************************************
24-08-11 Timing your runs.
         A perennial problem for many iceberg users have been the task of 
	 timing their tasks so as to estimate the time needed for production
	 runs. We now have a command named (timeused) to make this easier.
	 
	 Just type   timeused for further information on using this command.
	 
	 From today onwards,users of runabaqus, runansys and runfluent 
	 will automatically get the real-time-used reported at the end of
	 their job output files.
	                     
*****************************************************************************
23-08-11 Submitting ANSYS jobs on iceberg.
         A new command named runansys is made available for submitting ANSYS
         batch jobs on iceberg. Users are recommended to use this command 
         for submitting ANSYS jobs to run in BATCH mode ( rather than the 
	 method prescribed in ANSYS manuals ) . 
	   
	  Example usage1:   runansys  ansys_input_file 
	  
	  Example usage 2  (a big jobs requiring say 6G Bytes of memory):
	    
	    runansys ansys_input_file -mem=6G 
	   and provide an extra parameter to ansys as -m=4000 when asked
	   to do so.
	  
	 Type runansys on its own for further information.
	  
	  
	                         Report problems to D.Savas@sheffield.ac.uk

03-08-11 Using the Fortran NAG MK22 Library with the Intel Compilers ********

         NAG MK22 Numerical Routines Library can now be used with the 
         Intel compilers as as well the previously available PGI compilers.
          To compile a Fortan program ( for example test.f ) that calls one
         or more NAG routines you need to use the following commands;  
          - By using the pgi Compiler :  pgf90 test.f -lnag22 
          - By using the Intel Compiler :  ifortnag test.f  
*****************************************************************************
29-07-11 Maple is updated to the latest version (i.e. 15 ) on iceberg

         The following commands will access Maple 15 -
         maple  : command-line interface to Maple15
         xmaple : graphical  interface to  Maple15
         mint   : maple program analyser ( i.e. lint for maple )
         mhelp  : on-line maple documentation
*****************************************************************************
19-07-11 Maple software is due to be updated to version 15.
         Within the next two weeks, maple licenses will be renewed and the 
         latest version ( ver 15 ) will be made available on iceberg.
         The previous version(14) will continue to be available but the 
         earlier versions 12 and 13 will be withdrawn. 
         We still have a historic version ( version 10)  on iceberg due to
         the fact that it was not license controlled and hence remained 
         available. After the changes the following commands on iceberg
         will allow access to maple;
            maple & xmaple  : Run maple ver.15 in console or graphics mode
            maple14 & xmaple14 :  version 14 in console or graphics mode
            maple10 & xmaple10 :  version 10 in console or graphics mode
         Further announcements will follow.

              xstata  =  XWindows-mode 
*****************************************************************************
02-06-11  Matlab 2011a is installed on iceberg.
          The very latest version of Matlab is now installed on iceberg.
          Currently the relevant matlab 20011a commands are accessible via
          their names followed by the version number(i.e.2011a) on 
          all the worker nodes.

16-05-11  False ANSYS and FLUENT license expiry message.
          All Fluent & Ansys users have started receiving messages about 
	  the imminent expiry of licenses on 31st of May. 
	  This unfortunate 'FALSE WARNING' is due to the LSDYNA software
	  licenses that are served by the same license server that are due 
	  to expire on that date, but should not effect the Fluent and Ansys
	  users. 
*****************************************************************************
13-05-11  Matlab related changes taking place this evening:

          Command {matlab} will now invoke Matlab 2010bSP1 by default.
          Matlab license server will be restarted to serve licenses for 
          the latest version. There may be a brief interruption to Matlab
          services during the license update period.
	  Latest set of Matlab commands are;
            matlab  ( or matlab2010b )  for Matlab 2010b  Service Pack 1. 
            matlab2010a                 for Matlab 2010a
            matlab2009a                 for  Matlab 2009a
            matlab71                    for Version 7.1 ( 2005 release ) 
*****************************************************************************
20-04-11  Java Engines available on the worker nodes

          By default version 1.5 of Java is readily available on the worker 
	  nodes. A more recent version of Java (1.6) can also be made 
	  available for use on the worker nodes by issuing the command; 
	  
	    source use-java1.6 
	        
*****************************************************************************
20-04-11  MPI Parallel Programming environments *******
          Parallel Programming on iceberg using MPI can be achieved by a
	  number of different ways depending on the compiler and transport
	  mechanism used. To make life easier for iceberg users we now have 
	  a command named USEMPI that helps setup the user environment for 
	  a particular way of MPI programming.
	  This command must be invoked as [ source usempi ] and takes three
	  parameters. For example; source usempi pgi openmpi infiniband
	  
	  Type; source usempi   to find out all the available options.
	                                            
*****************************************************************************
14-04-11  Gnu Fortran & C compilers-later versions are available on iceberg

          By default Version 4.1.2 of the GNU Fortran and GNU C compilers are 
	  readily available on iceberg (Use commands: gcc & gfortran )
	  More recent version (i.e. V4.5.1) of these two compilers can also  
          accessed on iceberg after issuing either of the commands- 
	       source use-gfortran45
	   or  source use-gcc45
	    Subsequent uses of gcc and gfortran commands will access the 
	   more recent version. Also the subsequent man gcc and man gfortran 
	   commands will give information about version 4.5.1 of these 
	   compilers.  If not sure about which version you are accessing 
	   type       gcc -v to find out the version no.

06-04-11  Fluent/Ansys Research licenses have been increased from 100 to 125
          and the license server restarted at 7:50 this morning. 
	  Also the command [fluent] now runs the teaching version of Fluent.
	  Research version of Fluent can still be run by using the command 
	  [fluent12] instead of [fluent] 
	  The only difference between the Research and Teaching versions is
	  the limit on the number of cells which is 512,000 for the Teaching 
	  version but is not limited by the Research version. 
	  We have a lot of teaching licenses and a limited number of research
	  licenses. It is therefore strongly encouraged to use the teaching 
	  licenses if your problem size is below 512K cells. 
	  i.e. use [fluent] first and if you hit size limits use [fluent12]

05-04-11  Excessive demand on fluent and ansys research licenses.
          There is too much demand on fluent and ansys today that 
          are causing us to hit the limits of our licenses.
          Please try using fluenteach  or ansysteach commands to use the 
          teaching licenses if fluent and ansys commands complain 
          about shortage of licenses.  
*****************************************************************************
31-03-11  Fluent & Ansys License server updates causing interruption

          Early this morning we updated the ansys license server so as to be 
	  able to be able to move to version 13 in the near future. 
	  This has caused interruption to some Fluent and Ansys batch jobs 
	  on the iceberg cluster. If your job failed between 8.00am and 
	  9.15am this morning with licensing problems, please resubmit them. 
*****************************************************************************
28-03-11  Older version of ANSYS (ANSYS11) is withdrawn from iceberg.
          Licenses for the older version of ANSYS has finally run out 
	  and can no longer be used. 
	  Command [ansys] now accesses version 12 instead of version 11
*****************************************************************************
23-03-11  Early this morning the license server machine serving licenses
          for Fluent, Ansys, Gambit and Matlab went down and had to be

20-10-10 IMPORTANT CHANGE: Fluent 6.3 service is terminating on 1st of Nov.
 
         From 1st of November onwards only the latest version of Fluent 
	 ( i.e. 12.1 ) will be available on all campus machines including
	 iceberg. Our old Fluent licenses will run out and not be renewed. 
	 
	 Only the commands runfluent12 and fluent12 will work on iceberg.
	 Only ANSYS / FLuent12 will work on the Managed XP machines.
	 GAMBIT will continue to be available on all platforms until further 
	 notice. 
	 
	 From 1st of November onwards runfluent and fluent commands will
	 run version 12.1 of Fluent instead of version 6.3 .
                                  
*****************************************************************************
16-10-10 Parallel version of fluent12.1 is now working.  
         Fluent12.1 can now be used in parallel mode via the runfluent12
	 command.   
	 It now also has an extra ability to choose between two interconnect
	 options, namely; 
	    - Infiniband method : Fastest , but these nodes are heavily in
	                          demand so may have to wait longer on queues
	    - Gigabit Ethernet  : Not as fast but available on all nodes, 
	                          hence will not have to wait as long before
				  your jobs can be started.
	 When a runfluent12 job gets submitted, if you use the -t parameter
	 to specify parallel working, you will be asked to choose between
	 these two options. 
	 Type runfluent12  on its own for more info.
	 Within the next two weeks we will replace all fluent 6.3 software
	 on iceberg with fluent 12.1. runfluent command will then run 
	 version 12.1 instead of version 6.3.
	              Please report problems to iceberg-admins@shef.ac.uk
*****************************************************************************
13-10-10 Please use runfluent12 instead of runfluent to run your fluent jobs
          **** We have insufficient numbers of Fluent 6.3 licenses ***

         The latest version of Fluent (12.1) is meant to be compatible with
         the earlier versions.So,if you are already using runfluent to 
         submit your jobs, you can now run them by using runfluent12 instead.
         runfluent12 has exactly the same parameters as runfluent. As we 
         have plenty of licenses for version 12.1 there will be very little 
         risk of not being able to obtain licences for your job as it has
         been happening with Fluent 6.3 recently.
             Please report problems with runfluent12 to D.Savas@shef.ac.uk
*****************************************************************************
08-10-10 MORE UPDATE : A problem that stopped batch fluent jobs working
         have recently been highlighted and resolved. 
	 If you were having problems with submitting batch Fluent 6.3 jobs
	 please try again and let D.Savas@shef.ac.uk know if you are still
	 having problems. ( i.e. runfluent should work now! )
*****************************************************************************
23-09-10 FINAL UPDATE: All outstanding issues with Fluent 6.3 and Gambit have 
         now been resolved.
	 Also the latest version of Fluent and Ansys are now available.
         New commands are;
         fluent12   : to run Fluent 12.1
         ansys12wb  : to run latest version of Ansys/Fluent workbench. 
	  
	 Our thanks to Fluent and Gambit users for their patience.
                                                    D.Savas@sheffield.ac.uk
*****************************************************************************
22-09-10 UPDATE: Latest situation with Fluent/ANSYS problems.
         We have temporarily disabled fluent6.3 due to major system problems.
	 A security patch is expected within a day (or two) to fix problems
	 so that Fluent 6.3 can be made available again. 
	 
	 We have resolved all known problems with Ansys12.1 and Fluent12.1.
	 
	 Fluent12.1 is the latest version of Fluent and should be fully
	 compatible with Fluent 6.3. 
	 Therefore we recommend all fluent users to use fluent12.1 instead. 
	 To access it simply type -   fluent12   on a worker node.
	 
	 Fluent12.1 can also be accessed via the latest Ansys Workbench.
	 To run ansys workbench just type  ansys12wb .

         The previous version(13) can still be accessed via the maple13 and 
         xmaple13 commands but until the below mentioned kernel upgrade, it 
         will not be possible to use it.

20-09-10 Urgent Security Patch to iceberg cluster.
           Due to recently exposed major operating system vulnarabilities 
         we have been forced to make changes which disable the the 32-bit 
         compatibility libraries.
          Licensed applications have been tested and Maple13 and LS-Dyna are 
         the only ones that seem to be effected.
          Until a Unix-kernel upgrade becomes available, which is expected 
         soon there may be problems for software using the compatibility mode
         libraries.

         ANSYS 12.1 WORKBENCH , ANSYS 12.1 and FLUENT12.1 are now available
	 on iceberg for testing. All being well these software items will
	 replace the current versions of Fluent & Ansys on iceberg within
	 next two weeks. GAMBIT is also available under the ANSYS WORKBENCH.
	  The new commands are:
	     runfluent12   ( on head-node and worker nodes )
	     fluent12      ( on worker-nodes )
	     ansys12       ( on worker-nodes )

21-06-10 Having problems with your Linux environment? 
         If you find that your prompt has changed and you can no longer 
	 access some Linux commands and utilities it is very likely that
	 you have deleted your .bashrc file while you were tidying up your
	 filestore.
	  The cure is to type [resetenv]  followed by [bash] and you should
	 be back to normal with your .bashrc file recreated. The new .bashrc 
	 file will of course have lost any edits you may have previous done
	 to it.

13-04-10 Many thanks to all our iceberg Fluent users who allowed the Fluent
         teaching labs to take place by reducing their number of active 
	 fluent jobs. The situation is back to normal now. 
	 However more Fluent courses are planned for the next two weeks
	 which may have an impact on us again. The full course time-table
	 is published on http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/wrgrid/licenses.html
	 In the meanwhile, we have approached Fluent Inc for more teaching
	 licenses to alleviate the situation.

	 EXCEED software offers REXEC as well as SSH methods of access.
	 Even on Managed-XP machines REXEC method of Exceed is available. 
	 HOWEVER, iceberg no longer allows REXEC method of access to it.
	 This means, users who have been using the REXEC method will now 
	 get messages of the form 'Unable to Connect to host using specified
	 method'. When using EXCEED, please ensure that you are using the 
	 correct method by selecting 'Secure Shell' in the METHOD drop-down

26-06-09 Running Parallel Fluent jobs on Gigabit-ethernet connected nodes ***
         *****   runfluentx  ******
         Normal way of running parallel Fluent jobs is via the runfluent 
	 command ( see the earlier news item ).
	 However, currently there is a lot of demand for the new parallel 
	 hardware which is resulting in long wait times for parallel jobs.
	 Under these circumstances, for a quicker turn-round it will be
	 better to run parallel Fluent jobs on the older parallel nodes.
	 A command called runfluentx is available for doing just this. 
	 runfluentx works exactly the same as runfluent except that it uses
	 the earlier parallel hardware which is not as heavily used.
	 Type runfluentx    for more information.  
        
*****************************************************************************
25-06-09 AN EASY WAY TO RUN YOUR MATLAB BATCH JOBS : RUNMATLAB
         This is a reminder that you can submit your Matlab jobs for batch
	 processing on iceberg simply by using the runmatlab command.
	 For example; runmatlab mymatlabscript.m  -time 08:00:00
	 will submit a Matlab job for batch processing that executes all the 
	 Matlab commands contained in file mymatlabscript.m for upto 8 hours. 
	 Just type- runmatlab without any parameters for further information.
	 
	 This command was broken during last week when we implemented system
	 changes but it is fixed now.    
                                 Report problems to D.Savas@sheffield.ac.uk
*****************************************************************************
24-06-09 AN EASY WAY TO SUBMIT SERIAL OR PARALLEL FLUENT JOBS : RUNFLUENT

         A command called runfluent can be used to make submitting (qsub) of 
	 Fluent jobs much easier. 
	 On iceberg headnode,type   runfluent  for help on how to do this.
	  
	 EXAMPLE:   runfluent myfluent_Journal_file -time 12:00:00
	 
	 Parallel Fluent jobs can also be run easily on the new parallel
	 environment.
	 EXAMPLE:   runfluent myfluent_Journal_file -time 12:00:00 -t 8
	 
	 will run the same job as a parallel job on 8 nodes.
	 
	 Existing users of this command, please note that the parallel 
	 jobs submitted this way will now make use of the new parallel
	 environment. 
	                       Please report problems to D.Savas@shef.ac.uk  
*****************************************************************************
10-06-09 Running your jobs with certain memory requirements.
         After the latest re-configurations of the SGE scheduling system it  
	 is now possible to request specific amounts of memory to be made 
	 available to your jobs. This should hopefully alleviate the long-
	 standing issue of running jobs with large memory requirements.

08-06-09 Parallel Fluent Jobs on the older parallel nodes.
         With the new set of iceberg nodes coming into service we are hoping 
	 to move most of the parallel Fluent work onto the new nodes. 
	 However, in the meanwhile, it is still possible to run Fluent jobs
	 on the older paralllel setup via the old.parallel queues.Here is 
	 how that can be done: 
	
	 Assuming that you want to run a parallel Fluent job using 8 
	 processors, running for a maximum of 36 hours and using your Fluent- 
	 Journal file named myfljob.jou .
	 A script-file containing the following lines can be qsub'ed to 
	 run the desired job:
	  # 
	  # - Note:time--V -----------No. of Processors needed -----V
	  #$ -l h_cpu=36:00:00  -q old.parallel.q -cwd -pe mpich-gm 8
	  #$ -v FLUENT_INC=/usr/local/packages/Fluent.Inc,FLUENT_ARCH=lnamd64
	  #$ -v DISPLAY=NULL
	  #  - Note: assuming here to be 3D geom.-----V 
	  /usr/local/packages/Fluent.Inc/bin/fluent -v3ddp -g \
	  -i myfljob.jou -t8 -pethernet -cnf=$TMPDIR/machines
	  # Note: In -t8  8 matches the No. of processors quoted above 
	  
	  
         We might phase this service out when the latest version of Fluent 
	 (ANSYS/Fluent V12) becomes available later this summer.
	  
*****************************************************************************
01-06-09 Further information on the Intel Compilers 
         Latest version of the Intel Compilers (V11) as well as the previous
	 version (V10) are installed on iceberg.
	 Type      source use-intelv10         to use Version 10 
	 Type      source use-intelv11         to use Version 11 
	  
	 We currently do now have the MPI libraries for Version 11. 
	 Note: Use only on the workers(i.e after qsh)and not on the headnode.
	 
	 Notes on how to install the intel compilers on your own Linux 
	 machine and use the University licenses are available in :
	 
	  http://dsavas.staff.shef.ac.uk/software/ubuntu1.html  
	
	
*****************************************************************************
28-05-09 INTEL: C and Fortran Compilers have been updated.
         Version 10.1 of these compilers are now available on the iceberg 
	 cluster for general use. As Abaqus requires the V10 compiler we
	 have not updated these compilers on iceberg to the latest version.
	  We do however have a few floating licenses to allow users access 
	 to the latest version (V11) of these compilers from their own Linux 
	 workstations. 
	 Further details on how to access these will be published later.
	 If you wish to use the Intel Compilers on iceberg type; 
	     source  use-intel while using a worker node. 
	 You can also add [source use-intel]  to your .bashrc file to make
	 this automatic everytime you log in.

         will be updating the existing parallel environment.
	 80 older architecture cores will be taken out of service to be 
	 replaced by 184 new cores housed in 23 nodes(boxes), named HAWLEY
	 nodes. 
	 Each node will have 8 cores and 32GB or memory. They will also be 
	 interconnected with each other via high-speed/low-latency infiniband  
         switches. This is expected to greatly improve the performance of
	 the MPI jobs.  
	 The parallel.q will be modified to use the new nodes/environment.  
	 We will continue to make the existing parallel environments 
	 available to users under a temporary queue: old.parallel.q.  
	 We will be providing the OpenMPI and MvaPICH2 parallel environments 
	 on the new nodes, to replace the old environments.  
	 If you currently use the parallel.q then we advise you to migrate 
	 your code to the new environment as soon as possible,
	 as the old nodes will be removed from the cluster. 

*****************************************************************************
06-05-09 As part of the updates to the iceberg cluster, PGI Fortran/C/C++
         compilers will be updated to the latest version ( Ver:8.0-6 )  
	 within the next few days.

06-01-09 Fluent Licenses have been updated.
         We now have 90 Fluent licenses that are valid until August 2009.
	 Thanks to all Fluent/Gambit users for their patience. 
	 We are hoping to release floating Fluent licenses to Linux & Windows
	 users within the campus soon. Please contact D.Savas@shef.ac.uk
	 if you are interested in running Fluent on your own desktop. 
*****************************************************************************
10-11-08 Ongoing Fluent license problems. 
         Currently, we are getting low on the number of available Fluent 
	 licenses mainly due to increased number of parallel Fluent jobs
	 running on the iceberg cluster. We have requested for more licenses
	 and the situation should improve towards the end of this week.
	 
*****************************************************************************	 
09-10-08 The problems due to date discrepancy on some of the iceberg workers  
         have been fixed. The problem had effected only three of the worker 
	 nodes whose clocks had lost synchronism with the rest of the cluster  
	 
*****************************************************************************
08-10-08 Due to a problem with date setting software on some of the worker- 
         nodes, programs such as Fluent and Matlab which use floating 
	 licenses have failed to start on some of the iceberg workers.
	 We are investigating this problem.
*****************************************************************************
	 
27-08-08 Maple12 is now installed on iceberg and has become the default 
         version. I.e commands-  
	      maple, xmaple and mint  will now start the latest (12)version. 
         License for version 10 has run out.If MapleSoft allows us, we shall
	 continue to provide V10 via the commands ;
	      maple10 , xmaple10 and mint10  after announcing it here.

*****************************************************************************
04-02-08 This is a reminder for all users that the old iceberg scratch area 
         will be removed next Thursday 7th February.
         Users are reminded to move any of their data in /scratch to the new
         data area /data
         The iceberg scratch disks will be added to the new /data storage used 
         by iceberg

*****************************************************************************
17-01-08 ALL SGE QUEUE LIMITS ARE RESTORED. NFS HANDLES PROBLEMS REPORTED.
         All SGE queue limits that were limited (see previous two news items)
	 are now restored back to their default values.
	 
	 There has been some teething problems with the new store.
	 Please report stale NFS problems to helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk
*****************************************************************************
09-01-08 15:20 ALL EXCEPT SHORT INTERACTIVE QUEUES ARE DISABLED NOW !
         From now until iceberg restarts tomorrow ( the 10th of Jan, 08 ) all
	 the SGE queues except the short interactive queue are disabled. 
	 As the 'iceberg cluster' can go down any moment, please note that
	 your jobs will be running at your own risk from now on. 
	 Please see the following news item for more info.              
*****************************************************************************
04-01-08 TO UPGRADE ICEBERG STORAGE, SGE QUEUES ARE TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED  
	 This announcement is to inform iceberg users about ;               
  		A.  The risk of possible outages (due to maintenance work)  
  		B.  Winding down of the job queues on iceberg in preparation 
		    for the upgrade work.
	 As a result of impending maintenance work in the computer centre 
	 there will be an at risk period from Tuesday 8th January until 1800 
	 until the 10th of January. It is expected that iceberg will become 
	 unavailable on the 10th of January between 0900 and 1800. This will
	 give us an opportunity to upgrade its storage system to provide 9TB 
	 of storage dedicated to our HPC users.
	 In preparation for these events the Sun Grid Engine queues are  
	 being wound down.Long queues are NOW disabled and other queues are 
	 modified to restrict the cpu limits to 8 hours or less. 
	 If job times ( -l H_CPU ) are specified and in excess of 8 hours  
	 these job will never start to run. 
	 If no -l H_CPU parameter is specified, any job exceeding 8 hours 
	 will simply be killed with possible loss of all results.
	 
	 ONCE THE STORAGE UPGRADE IS COMPLETED;
	 -  users home areas will be under /home/username, 
	 -  users will initially have 5GB of backed-up storage allocation 
	    in their home area (backed up nightly),
         -  non-backed-up permenant user data will continue to reside in
	     /data/username with a SUBSTANTIALLY increased quota 
	     of 50 GB per user,
         -  the current scratch area /scratch on iceberg will be removed 
	     the following week.Therefore users are advised to move any 
	     data they require under /scratch to /data/username area.
	    
	 There will be further announcements before /scratch is actually 
	 removed.

10-01-07 ANNOUNCEMENT ON ICEBERG UPGRADE PLANS   
         A number of changes and upgrades are planned for for the central 
	 computation facility, Iceberg, to be completed by early summer 2007,
	 as follows.

         (a) A software update to Rocks, including Open MPI available on 
	     all nodes.

         (b) The head node to be doubled in capacity,from 4 cores to 8 cores.

         (c) Increased storage will come available.

         (d) A hardware upgrade will increase throughput by perhaps 50%. 
	 
	 The 40 2-way worker nodes (with 80 processors in total) will be 
	 replaced by about 160 processor cores in nodes which are expected to 
	 have 8 cores.The memory will remain at 2GB per core, but memory is 
	 not currently under pressure and with more cores in each node, there 
	 will be more flexibility to run larger jobs.
         The 20 4-way nodes, each with 4GB/core, interconnected by Myrinet 
	 will remain in service until 2008-2009, for the small number of 
	 users who benefit from the low latency MPI interconnect.

         The replaced worker nodes will be allocated to to high-energy 
	 physics, for ppGrid, which will be handling the analysis of data 
	 from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, due to be switched on later
	 in 2007.

         Comments and questions about this plan can be addressed to 
	 Chris Cartledge, c.cartledge@sheffield.ac.uk on Ext: 23008.

27-09-06 NAG Library Mark 21 is installed. 
         The latest version of the NAG library(MK21) is now available on 
	 iceberg as well as the previous version (MK20) that existed. 
	 To compile and link a Fortran ( 90 or 77) program with this library
	 use the following commands: 
	      pgf77 yourprog.f -lnag21 -lacml
	   or
	      pgf90 yourprog.f90 -lnag21 -lacml

	 Gambit is now updated to the more recent version 2.2.3 on iceberg 
	 worker nodes. This should hopefully not effect the present users 
	 of Gambit and their Gambit files. If you are having problems with 
	 the new version of Gambit, you can still continue to use the 
	 previous version by starting Gambit with the -r2.1.2 parameter.

11-05-06 Comsol usage on iceberg:
	 The default release of Matlab on iceberg is the 64-bit version which
	 should allow Matlab users to handle larger problems. 
	 However,  there is no 64bit version of Comsol released for this
	 platform yet and therefore comsol must be invoked with a 32-bit 
	 version of matlab.  Therefore the command to invoke Comsol with 
	 Matlab can be either ;
	     comsol matlab71_32
	  or 
	     comsol matlab7

23-02-06 E-Science Event at LEEDS University on 28th of MARCH.

  	 Enabling the Research of Future: A range of e-Infrastructure 
	 developments are  maturing and grid computing is increasingly used 
	 as a basis for the computation and data management required by 
	 collaborative research. These innovative developments more often 
	 provide the underpinnings for novel multidisciplinary and 
	 collaborative research environments. The White Rose University 
	 Consortium, the White Rose Grid e-Science Centre and the National 
	 e-Science Centre training team are running this free one day seminar 
         to introduce e-Infrastructure and how it enables research.
	 As places are limited please check the following web site for further
	 information and registration as soon as possible.

20-02-06 A Note on Fluent Help Files
	 Fluent requires a web browser to display its help files internally.
	 However we do not have web browsers installed on the worker nodes 
	 and we longer allow running fluent on the head node.   
	 This means that it is no longer possible to access the Fluent Help 
	 files from within Fluent. 
	 Either of following two methods will allow you to access the Fluent 
	 Help Files:
	    - Type:  docs   on iceberg head node and follow links to 
	      fluent documentation.
	    - Using your web browser, point to the following URL:     
		https://iceberg2.shef.ac.uk/docs/fluent/index.html
		                                         D.Savas@shef.ac.uk

13-02-06 How to increase your effective 'iceberg filestore' by taking 
         advantage of your PC's spare hard-disk capacity:
	 If you are running short of filestore allocation on 'iceberg' 
	 this could be one way of solving your problems on your own. 
	 However, you must be aware that anything stored and accessed from 
	 your PC in this way will not be backed-up on iceberg and so you must 
	 do your own backups of important files. 
	 See the following URL for further details:

09-02-06 The latest version of MATLAB (V7.1)(R14SP3)(64bit) is now installed.
	 Tme previous version V7.0.1 ( R14SP1) will soon be removed and all
	 references to Matlab will run this latest version.
	 During the transition period the latest version will only be 
	 accessible via the following commands;
	   matlab71    : Matlab (V7.1)(R14SP3) (64-bit ) (Without Symb.Maths)
	   matlab71_32 : Matlab (V7.1)(R14SP3 ) (32-bit )(With Symb.Maths)
	   mex71       : Mex builder
	   mcc71       : Matlab c (c++) compiler for generating executables.
           mbuild71    : Matlab stand-alone executable builder.
	   In due course, the document pages via <docs> command will also
	   be updated to reflect these changes. 
	   Please check your current script files with the latest version
	   to make sure that they still work (which they should!) .

*****************************************************************************
11-11-05 Both Matlab and Fluent commands have now been restricted to run only
         under the sun-grid-engine. If you are use to logging into iceberg
	 and typing matlab or fluent, you now need to log into iceberg as
	 usual and then type qsh to get an interactive SGE session and run 
	 matlab or fluent in that window as usual.
*****************************************************************************
27-10-05 Changing your own default shell

         Some users have requested the ability to change their default
         shell to something other than Bash

         You can now do this using the ldapchsh command

         For more information run ldapchsh

14-06-05 Ansys Upgrade

         Ansys has been upgraded from
         Ansys University Advanced to Ansys University Research

         Changing the Ansys model limits from 128000 to 512000 nodes
****************************************************************************
02-06-05 On-line documentation on iceberg is now on the WEB
         Most of the HTML and PDF format manuals and documentation provided
	 with software and packages on iceberg as well as the home produced 
	 documents on how to use iceberg are now available on the web.
	 To access these pages please point your browser to - 
	     https://iceberg.shef.ac.uk/docs/
	 This is a secure site that will enforce passworded access for the
	 remote 'i.e. non-sheffield-univ' users.
	  
	 If you do not have a browser on your workstation and you are using 
	 X-terminal access to iceberg, the command <B> docs </B> can also be used to 
	 access these pages via the mozilla browser.

12-05-05 16:20pm Fluent Documentation is now installed. Help and user-guides
         are accessible via the Help menu of the Fluent task-bar.
*****************************************************************************
12-05-05 The official latest version (V6.2.16) of Fluent is now installed
         on iceberg to replace the previous release (V6.2.15). 
	 The documentation and help will be installed as soon as possible.
	 Until that is done there will be no help from within Fluent.
	 Please accept our apologies & watch news for further announcements.
	                          Report problems to D.Savas@sheffield.ac.uk	 
*****************************************************************************
10-05-05 The way parallel Fluent jobs are started has been changed to avoid 
         the intermittent problems some users have been having. This change 
	 also allows us to run Parallel Fluent jobs 'out-of-the-box'. 
	 This implies that we can now theoretically run massively parallel 
	 Fluent jobs, using up-to 80 processors at a time !!!  
	 Whether this is sensible or practical is another matter.
	 Number of processors to use is specified via the -t parameter of
	 the runfluent command. Type runfluent on its own for more details.

18-03-05 Many users FTP transfers of ASCII files (non-binary,machine-readable
         files) have failed to come across correctly. These files contain 
	 an extra ^M at the end of each line but they remain invisible to 
	 most file viewer. One way of checking if your ASCII file, such as 
	 Fluent Journal file is correct is to view it with cat -v command.
	 E.g.  cat -v filename. 
	 If you see ^M at end of lines then correct the file by typing;
	       dos2unix filename 
	       
	 P.S. dos2unix may reset the file access rights, so you may have to
	 check and re-define these rights via the chmod command.
*****************************************************************************
16-03-05 The commands runfluent and runmatlab can be used to make submitting
         Fluent & Matlab jobs respectively easier.
	 Just type runfluent   or runmatlab  without any parameters for 
	 information on how to use them.

06-01-05 New High Throughput Computer.
         (**start date has changed to week beginning 14 February)

	 CICS is pleased to announce a new high throughput computer,
	 Iceberg, due to be in service in the week beginning 14 February
	 2005. The system is being supplied by Sun Microsystems and
	 will have 2.4GHz AMD Opteron (PC technology) processors which
	 are currently the fastest available for computation, at about
	 three times the performance of processors on Titania. The
	 system will run 64-bit Scientific Linux, which is Redhat
	 based. Iceberg has 160 processors for general use and
	 connection to the White Rose Grid. Eighty of these processors
	 are in 4-way nodes with 16GB main memory coupled by a double
	 speed (4Gb/s) low latency Myrinet network, for parallel and
	 high memory use. A further 80 processors are in 2-way nodes
	 with 4GB main memory, for general high throughput computation
	 use. In addition 160 processors in 2-way nodes are reserved
	 for GridPP (the particle physics Grid).

	 Titania users will be registered automatically on Iceberg and
	 it is expected that take up will be high, because Iceberg will
	 have six times the overall throughput. Titania will remain in
	 service for as long as it is needed by users and at least
	 until September 05, but at reduced (one quarter) capacity.
	 Iceberg is planned to have all the commonly used software that
	 is on Titania, but some applications are not yet available and
	 others are currently 32-bit only. Iceberg will have Open MP
	 and MPI support, including the parallel debugger DDT. More
	 detailed information of the software to be available at the
	 start of the user service will be given at the time.

	 The additional dedicated staffing necessary for system
	 management, training and user support has been underwritten by
	 the university, but there is an expectation that large users
	 of the system will make a contribution to costs. No mechanism
	 has been agreed as yet. but CICS will be in contact with the
	 larger users on Titania.

         HIGH THROUGHPUT FACTS AND FIGURES
         Processors: 320
         Performance: 300GFLOPs
         Main Memory: 800GB
         Filestore: 9TB
         Physical size: 7 racks
         Power usage: 40KW
